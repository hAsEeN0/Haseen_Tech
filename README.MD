 ## What is NoSQL  

  

>NoSQL is also called “Not Only SQL” or “Not SQL”. NoSQL means the data is stored in a non-relational data type. Generally, in NoSQL, the data is **unstructured** when compared to SQL. NoSQL is used to store a large amount of data. It is used in every organization in the world. This is a very convenient database because it is good at scalability, flexibility, and functionality. In NoSQL, the operations are made very fast.  

  

 ## NoSQL Database

>NoSQL doesn't require a fixed schema. The databases are designed for several data access patterns. These are partitionable as the scalability of data increases that provides consistent performance. These databases are divided into the category of data they fall in like,



- **Key-Value Pair Based**   

- **Document-Based**  

- **Column Based**  

- **Graph-Based**

>The NoSQL databases are partitioned into some categories. These databases are optimized for performance and scale. They are as follows  

- **MongoDB**  

- **Apache Cassandra**  

- **Redis**  

- **Couchbase**  

- **Apache HBase**  

  

# MongoDB

> **MongoDB** falls in the category of **Document based Database**. It is a simple and dynamic object-oriented database and it uses JSON format for schemas. It is classified as a NoSQL database program.
> 
> <br> It supports range queries and regular expression searches. It can be used as a file system called Grid file system with load balancing and data replication features for storing files.  



 # Apache Cassandra

> **Apache Cassandra** falls in the category of **Column based Database**. For scalability and availability, Cassandra is the right one. It is a free and open-source distributed NoSQL database. 
> 
> <br>Cassandra offers support for clusters spanning multiple data centers. It is used for the deployment of a large number of nodes across multiple data centers. It is mainly used for multiple data center deployment, redundancy, failover, and disaster recovery.  



 ## Redis

> **Redis** falls in the category of **key-value pair-based Database**. It is also known as Remote Dictionary Server. It is an open-source memory data structure store and supports different kinds of data structures like hashes, sets, strings lists, etc. 
> 
> <br>It is also used as a database cache and message broker. Master-replica replication is supported by Redis which can replicate any number of replicas.  



 ## Couchbase

> **Couchbase** falls in the category of **Document based Database**. It provides easy-to-scale key-value or JSON document access with low latency and high sustained throughput. It is an open-source distributed multi-model software package. 
> 
> <br>It is also known as Membase. It is used to support applications where a flexible data model, easy scalability, and consistent high performance are required.  

  

 ## Apache HBase

> **HBase** falls in the category of **column-based Database**. It is an open-source non-relational distributed database. It runs on the top of HDFS providing Bigtable like capabilities for Hadoop. 
> 
> <br/>It is used to have random, real-time read or write access to big data. It hosts large tables on top of clusters of commodity hardware. It allows data compression and is ideal for sparse data.     


 # key points 


- NoSQL databases often exchange some ACID properties of relational databases for a more flexible data model that can scale horizontally. 

- For accessing and managing data it uses variety of data models. 

- These types of databases are optimized specifically for applications that require large data volume, low latency, and flexible data models.
